## React Workflow

# ⚠️  Disclaimer

Instead of using this project, prefer  [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

----------

### What's inside it?

-   Callback Functions / Async-await
-   Promises
-   Array Functions
-   Props
-   States
-   Lifecycle
-   Contacts App 
-   ToDo App
-   Style Definitions


### Dependencies:

-   Node.js  `>=`  8.12;

### Up and running

-   Clone this repository:  `gh repo clone HasanRs/react-calisma-ortami`;
-   Remove  `.git`  directory;
-   Install dependencies:  `yarn`  (or  `npm i`);
-   Run  `yarn dev`  (or  `npm start`) to develop on  `http://localhost:3000`
-   Run  `yarn build`  (or  `npm run build`) for production build (files will be generated on  `dist`  directory)

### Troubleshooting
    ---

## Scripts

-   `yarn dev (or npm run dev)`: Starts the application on development mode
-   `yarn test (or npm test)`: Run tests once
-   `yarn test:watch (or npm run test:watch)`: Run tests in watch mode
-   `yarn build (or npm run build)`: Build project to production
-   `yarn update-packages`: Update all packages to the latest version
-   `yarn start (or npm start)`: Special script reserved to run production code. Change as you wish. For now, it is the same as  `yarn dev`.
